# JUICEBOX

Description: A fully operational CRUD API that uses Express.JS, PostgreSQL, and Prisma, to create a Tumblr-like website for blogging and networking. 


What I did: 
I recreated the Juicebox API from scratch 
    •	Created a database schema model and seed file using Prisma to establish relationships between users, tags, posts and create initial           user data. 
    •	Converted Express API CRUD routes interacting with a PostgreSQL database to use Prisma instead. 


#Tools and Technologies used: JavaScript, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, Prisma.
